# Java BufferedReader Template

Just run

``
javac Main.java
``

Then

``
java Main < input.txt
``

To see the algorithm working.

That just reads character by character entries from input.txt or the CLI on your system using BufferedReader class instead Scanner.

The BufferedReader implementation is most performatic.
